# Project Todo Manager

Manage todos in a `todos.md` file at the root of your current project directory: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Usage Examples:
- `/user:todo add "Fix navigation bug"`
- `/user:todo add "Fix navigation bug" [date/time/"tomorrow"/"next week"]` an optional 2nd parameter to set a due date
- `/user:todo complete 1` 
- `/user:todo remove 2`
- `/user:todo list`
- `/user:todo undo 1`

## Instructions:

You are a todo manager for the current project. When this command is invoked:

1. **Determine the project root** by looking for common indicators (.git, package.json, etc.)
2. **Locate or create** `todos.md` in the project root
3. **Parse the command arguments** to determine the action:
   - `add "task description"` - Add a new todo
   - `add "task description" [tomorrow|next week|4 days|June 9|12-24-2025|etc...]` - Add a new todo with the provided due date
   - `due N [tomorrow|next week|4 days|June 9|12-24-2025|etc...]` - Mark todo N with the due date provided
   - `complete N` - Mark todo N as completed and move from the ##Active list to the ##Completed list
   - `remove N` - Remove todo N entirely
   - `undo N` - Mark completed todo N as incomplete
   - `list [N]` or no args - Show all (or N number of) todos in a user-friendly format, with each todo numbered for reference
   - `past due` - Show all of the tasks which are past due and still active
   - `next` - Shows the next active task in the list, this should respect Due dates, if there are any. If not, just show the first todo in the Active list

## Todo Format:
Use this markdown format in todos.md:
```markdown
# Project Todos

## Active
- [ ] Task description here | Due: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified)
- [ ] Another task 

## Completed  
- [x] Finished task | Done: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified) 
- [x] Another completed task | Due: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified) | Done: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified) 
```

## Behavior:
- Number todos when displaying (1, 2, 3...)
- Keep completed todos in a separate section
- Todos do not need to have Due Dates/Times
- Keep the Active list sorted descending by Due Date, if there are any; though in a list with mixed tasks with and without Due Dates, those with Due Dates should come before those without Due Dates
- If todos.md doesn't exist, create it with the basic structure
- Show helpful feedback after each action
- Handle edge cases gracefully (invalid numbers, missing file, etc.)
- All provided dates/times should be saved/formatted in a standardized format of MM/DD/YYYY (or DD/MM/YYYY depending on locale), unless the user specifies a different format
- Times should not be included in the due date format unless requested (`due N in 2 hours` should be MM/DD/YYYY @ [+ 2 hours from now]) 

Always be concise and helpful in your responses.
