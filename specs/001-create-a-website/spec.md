# Feature Specification: ShadCN Component Aggregator

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-website`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a website that crawls and displays all the component examples of 7 shadcn UI component websites. The navigation and categorization of components needs to be related to both source and type dimensions. The website can query examples from different categories based on a certain source, or examples from different sources based on different categories. All examples are real renderings, not simulated clones."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer evaluating UI component libraries, I want to browse and compare component examples from multiple shadcn-based websites in one place, so I can quickly find the best component implementation for my project without visiting multiple sites individually.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the aggregator homepage, **When** a user selects "Buttons" category, **Then** all button components from all 7 sources are displayed in a grid with source attribution
2. **Given** the aggregator homepage, **When** a user selects a specific source website, **Then** all components from that source are displayed organized by component type
3. **Given** a component is displayed, **When** a user interacts with it, **Then** the component responds with its actual behavior (hover states, clicks, animations)
4. **Given** the dual-axis navigation, **When** a user filters by source AND component type, **Then** only matching components are shown
5. **Given** a component example, **When** a user requests the code, **Then** the original component code is displayed with proper formatting

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a source website is unavailable during crawling? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: fallback behavior - show cached version, error message, or skip?]
- How does the system handle component updates on source websites? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: update frequency - real-time, scheduled, or manual?]
- What happens when a component fails to render? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error display strategy - placeholder, error boundary, or removal?]
- How does the system handle duplicate component names across sources?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST crawl and index component examples from 7 shadcn UI component websites [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific 7 websites?]
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide dual-axis navigation allowing users to filter by source website, component type, or both simultaneously
- **FR-003**: System MUST display actual, interactive component renderings (not static images or recreated clones)
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to view all components from a single source website
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to view all components of a specific type across all sources
- **FR-006**: System MUST display component metadata including source website, component name, and last updated date
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to search for components by name or description
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **FR-009**: System MUST display component source code on demand
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle component loading states gracefully with appropriate feedback
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain component categorization consistency across different sources
- **FR-012**: System MUST update its component database when source websites change [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: update trigger - scheduled, webhook, or manual?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide clear attribution and links back to original source websites
- **FR-014**: Users MUST be able to view component variants and examples with different props
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve component interactivity and animations as they exist on source websites

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Component preview loading time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target load time - 2s, 3s, 5s?]
- **PR-002**: Search response time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target response time - 200ms, 500ms, 1s?]
- **PR-003**: Maximum concurrent users [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected scale - 100, 1000, 10000 users?]
- **PR-004**: Component rendering performance [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: frame rate targets for animations?]

### Data Requirements
- **DR-001**: Component data retention policy [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how long to cache crawled data?]
- **DR-002**: Source website crawl frequency [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how often to check for updates?]
- **DR-003**: Version history requirements [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: track component version changes over time?]

### Key Entities
- **Component**: Represents an individual UI component with properties: name, type, source website, code, preview URL, metadata, last updated, variants
- **Source Website**: Represents one of the 7 shadcn UI websites with properties: name, URL, crawl status, last crawled date, component count, version info
- **Component Type**: Represents a category of components with properties: name, description, common properties, example use cases
- **Component Instance**: Represents a specific rendering of a component with properties: component reference, props configuration, rendering state, interaction handlers
- **Crawl Job**: Represents a crawling operation with properties: source website, start time, status, components found, errors encountered

## Outstanding Clarifications Summary

1. **Source Websites**: Which 7 specific shadcn UI component websites should be crawled?
2. **Update Frequency**: How often should the system check for component updates (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly)?
3. **Performance Targets**: Specific targets for load times, response times, and concurrent users
4. **Error Handling**: Fallback behavior when source websites are unavailable
5. **Data Retention**: How long to cache component data and whether to maintain version history
6. **Authentication**: Are any source websites behind authentication/paywalls?
7. **Legal Considerations**: License compliance and permission to display third-party components
8. **Component Rendering**: Strategy for sandboxing/isolating component rendering
9. **Update Detection**: Method for detecting changes (polling, webhooks, RSS feeds)
10. **Storage Limits**: Maximum storage allocation for cached components and code
