# Spec Kit App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards
All code MUST adhere to consistent formatting, linting, and architectural patterns.
Code reviews are mandatory before merging. Static analysis tools MUST pass without
warnings. Documentation is required for all public APIs and complex business logic.
Clean code principles apply: readable, maintainable, and self-documenting code is
non-negotiable.

### II. Testing Requirements
Comprehensive test coverage is mandatory with minimum 80% coverage for new code.
Unit tests MUST be written before or alongside feature implementation. Integration
tests are required for all API endpoints and critical user workflows. All tests
MUST pass in CI/CD pipeline before deployment. Test-driven development is
encouraged for complex features.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces MUST follow established design system guidelines and
accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum). Consistent interaction patterns,
visual hierarchy, and responsive design across all platforms are required. User
feedback and error messaging MUST be clear, actionable, and user-friendly.
Cross-browser compatibility testing is mandatory.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Application MUST load within 3 seconds on standard connections. Database queries
MUST be optimized with proper indexing and query analysis. Bundle sizes MUST be
monitored and kept minimal through code splitting and lazy loading. Performance
regressions require immediate attention and cannot be merged without resolution.
Monitoring and alerting are required for production performance metrics.

## Development Standards

Applications MUST use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. All
dependencies MUST be kept up-to-date with security patches applied promptly.
Environment-specific configurations MUST be externalized and never hardcoded.
Secrets and sensitive data MUST be properly secured and never committed to
version control.

## Quality Gates

All code changes MUST pass automated testing, linting, and security scans.
Peer code review is required with at least one approval before merging.
Breaking changes MUST be documented and include migration guides. Performance
impact assessment is required for significant changes. Production deployments
require approval and follow established release procedures.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines.
Amendments require team consensus and documentation of the change rationale.
All pull requests MUST verify compliance with these principles. Violations
require immediate remediation or explicit justification with technical debt
tracking. Constitution compliance is reviewed quarterly and updated as needed.
